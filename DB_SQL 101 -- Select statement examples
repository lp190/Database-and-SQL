# The general syntax of SELECT statement is:

select COLUMN1, COLUMN2, ... from TABLE1;



# To retrieve a list of all country names and their IDs from the COUNTRY table we would issue:

select ID, NAME from COUNTRY;


# To retrieve all  columns from the COUNTRY table use *

select * from COUNTRY;


# The where clause can be added to your query to filter results or get specific rows of data. To retrieve data for all rows in the COUNTRY table where the ID is less than 5:

select * from COUNTRY where ID < 5;

# In case of character based columns the values of the predicates in the where clause need to be enclosed in single quotes. To retrieve the data
for the country with code "CA" we would issue:

select * from COUNTRY where CCODE = "CA";
